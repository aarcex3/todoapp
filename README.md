# Todo App

This is a simple todo app made with FastAPI\
What makes it different is the fact that its structured like a nestjs project


# Motivation
Just for fun.\
There are frameworks and libraries like [PyNest](https://github.com/PythonNest/PyNest), [Litestar](https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar) and [fastapi-controller](https://pypi.org/project/fastapi-controller/) that already implement this.\
Just wanted to try to replicate the folders\/files structure and conventions.
